   *
   * I really like using that you're encapsulating the logic for checking if the URL is found
   * in a variable. It makes the code easier to read and understand.
   *
   * One pattern that's common for naming these variables is to use the word "is" or "has" at the beginning.
   * For example, you could name this variable "isUrlFound" or "hasUrl".
   *
   * "found_url" is pretty good, but it seems like it could also be a string, like it's the url you found.
   *
   * The "is" pattern is common so it's something another developer would understand quickly.
   *
   * (remove the comments above them, though. Your great names are enough.)

  /** Musings
   *
   * One risk of leaving overly verbose comments in place is that it
   * can kind of look like you might have used copilot to write the code.
   *
   * Like one thing I have done is write a comment, let copilot write the code,
   * review it, and remove the comment.
   *
   * I think doing it this way is ok, but it's good to remove the comments because they
   * are no longer needed. Also, I think if someone is evaluating a junior engineer's code,
   * they want to be sure that you wrote the code yourself and understand it.
